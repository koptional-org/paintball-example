# Extreme Paintball Web App

This repository contains a `frontend` and a `backend` folder. To run the application, you'll run both.

In one terminal:

```bash
cd backend
yarn install && yarn start
```

And in another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install && yarn start
```

**NOTE**: the frontend expects that the backend runs on port 8000. So if you change that, make sure to update the frontend API URL.
